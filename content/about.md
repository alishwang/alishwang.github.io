Here is **Fuhua Wang (Alish, 王富华)**.

I am starting a robotics company, embracing the wave of AI, hoping to contribute value to society, contribute to the development of the times, and make AI better serve humanity. I have been in the computer industry for the past decade, from the Internet of Things to mobile phones and now to AI robots. The development of the times is far faster than our personal abilities. Take advantage of the current trend to create the value needed by the era, rather than sticking to the established trend and cheering for the sunset industry!

我正在创办一家机器人公司，拥抱AI浪潮，希望为社会贡献价值，为时代的发展添砖加瓦，让AI更好的为人类服务。近十年我都在计算机行业，从物联网到手机再到现在的AI机器人，时代的发展远比我们个人的能力发展快。趁现在找准趋势，创造所处时代需要的价值，而不是守着已经成形的趋势，为夕阳产业干杯喝彩！

- **ROS2** Our current product is built on ROS2, and I am responsible for the technical part. With my previous work experience and summary, I have developed good learning ability and troubleshooting habits, so my understanding of ROS2 is quite comprehensive.
- **Jetson** At present, most robot products are developed based on the Jetson platform, and our understanding of a platform is also an advantage.

- **ROS2** 我们现在的产品就是基于ROS2搭建的，我负责技术部分，加上以前的工作经验和总结，有了良好的学习能力和排查习惯，所以对ROS2的了解比较到位。
- **Jetson** 现阶段大部分机器人产品都是基于Jetson平台在开发，我们的也不例外，对一个平台的了解程度也是一种优势。
